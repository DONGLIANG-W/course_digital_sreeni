# 19
filter image with scipy.ndimage function, such as sobel, gaussian filter

# 20 
filter image with skimage functions, such as resize, rescale, robert, 
scharr, prewitt, canny
a real case presents the thresholding with how to deal with low contrast
image with entropy function

# 21
continue the real case study, study the scratch cell recovery rate

# 25
introduction of opencv, color channels, cv2.split(), cv2.merge()

# 26
denoise and edge detection with opencv. cv2.Canny()

# 27
introduced different method of histogram equalization. 
1. Global histogram equalization, cv2.equalizeHist()
2. localized adaptive histogram equalization CLAHE
3. threshold with manual input; cv2.threshold()

# 28
cv2 median filter
cv2 thresholding, otsu
morphological processing, with cv2 erosion, dilation
cv2 openning, closing 

# 29
In the pictures, there are corners that more meaningful to be used as 
features, the features are patterns with identical character could be used
to register the object in the image. this concept is introduced in the 
computer vision - SIFT descriptor
In CV2, there are various way to find the feature points, includes Harris
corner, Shi-Tomasi corner, SIFT, FAST, BRIEF, ORB
Sreeni highlighted the importance of ORB. A real case study using the ORB 
is presented in the next session
